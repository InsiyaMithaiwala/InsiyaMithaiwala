# Hey there! 👋

## 🚀 About Me
Welcome to my coding adventure! 🚀 I'm Insiya Mithaiwala, a Front End Web Developer, a passionate and ambitious computer science student currently cruising through my 7th semester. 
Ready to dive into the tech world with all cylinders firing!

🌟 The MERN Stack Virtuoso
I'm not your average developer; I'm a MERN stack enthusiast on a mission. With a knack for crafting seamless applications using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, I bring a blend of efficiency and elegance to the coding table.

✨ Connecting with the Web3 Community
While I may be a newcomer, I'm eager to connect with the vibrant Web3 community. Whether you're a seasoned explorer or fellow newcomer, let's embark on this journey together. Share insights, collaborate on projects, and let the collective wisdom of the community propel us forward.

🎸 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from guitar, break dancing (hip-hop), sketching.

📚 I also love reading books on personal development,Fictional Stories And Novels. My favorite ones are From Agatha Christie.

✈️ I love traveling too.
